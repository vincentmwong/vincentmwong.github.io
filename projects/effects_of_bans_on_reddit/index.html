<h2 id="does-banning-stuff-work">Does banning stuff work?</h2>

<p>Even though the internet is renowned for being a cesspool of hate, a lot of media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Discord) have been cracking down on this kind of content by banning people or communities associated with certain movements. But there&rsquo;s one big unanswered question: Is it working?</p>

<p>In some cases, these communities backlash and have a hydra-like effect: cut off one hand and two more spring up in its place. When Reddit banned r/FatPeopleHate in mid-2015, a number of new subreddits dedicated to the content appeared, and users of the subreddit also reportedly spilled the content into other subreddits. [Other specific examples here]. From the perspective of social systems, this is interesting because it shows that a lot of dynamics are at play. If people are motivated enough to backlash this way, do they just let go of their desire for this content? Where do they go?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s very little formal research about the effects of administrative action on social media, or about their effects on online social networks. A previous (and popular) study found that there was less hatespeech across Reddit after a hate subreddit was banned. It&rsquo;s not clear from that study how the banning translated to the social dynamics that resulted in the backlash seen by reporters and bystanders.</p>

<h2 id="networks-of-communities">Networks of Communities</h2>

<p>I wanted to study the community dynamics using network science as part of a class project on Network Science. I looked at the case when Reddit banned r/altright which was banned in early 2017 for allegedly breaking Reddit&rsquo;s terms of service by spreading personal information about people.</p>

<p>Reddit data is publicly available on pushshift.io, a repository collected live. We took the posts from users who posted in r/altright in the months before r/altright was banned, and we looked at the effect of the ban on the community.</p>

<p>We created networks of users that interacted with each other on reddit. After the ban, there were around 30% <strong>fewer</strong> people in the network.</p>

<p>A lot of the structures in the network stayed the same, but a lot more people changed than expected.</p>
